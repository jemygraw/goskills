# GoSkills - Claude Skills Management Tool

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

A powerful command-line tool to parse, manage, and execute Claude Skill packages. GoSkills is designed according to the specifications found in the [official Claude documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/).

## Features

- **Skill Management**: List, search, parse, and inspect Claude skills from local directories
- **Runtime Execution**: Execute skills with LLM integration (OpenAI, Claude, and compatible APIs)
- **Built-in Tools**: Shell commands, Python execution, file operations, web fetching, and search
- **MCP Support**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration
- **Dual CLI Tools**: Separate tools for skill management and execution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with coverage reports

## Installation

### From Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/smallnest/goskills.git
cd goskills
make
```

### Using Homebrew

```shell
brew install smallnest/goskills/goskills
```

Or:

```shell
# add tap
brew tap smallnest/goskills

# install goskills
brew install goskills
```

## Quick Start

```shell
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# List available skills
./goskills-cli list ./skills

# Run a skill
./goskills run "create a react component for a todo app"
```

## Built-in Tools

GoSkills includes a comprehensive set of built-in tools for skill execution:

- **Shell Tools**: Execute shell commands and scripts
- **Python Tools**: Run Python code and scripts
- **File Tools**: Read, write, and manage files
- **Web Tools**: Fetch and process web content
- **Search Tools**: Wikipedia and Tavily search integration
- **MCP Tools**: Integration with Model Context Protocol servers

## CLI Tools

GoSkills provides two command-line tools for different purposes:

### 1. Skill Management CLI (`goskills-cli`)

Located in `cmd/skill-cli`, this tool helps you inspect and manage your local Claude skills.

#### Building `goskills-cli`

```shell
make cli
# or
go build -o goskills-cli ./cmd/skill-cli
```

#### Available Commands

#### list
Lists all valid skills in a given directory.
```shell
./goskills-cli list ./testdata/skills
```

#### parse
Parses a single skill and displays a summary of its structure.
```shell
./goskills-cli parse ./testdata/skills/artifacts-builder
```

#### detail
Displays the full, detailed information for a single skill, including the complete body content.
```shell
./goskills-cli detail ./testdata/skills/artifacts-builder
```

#### files
Lists all the files that make up a skill package.
```shell
./goskills-cli files ./testdata/skills/artifacts-builder
```

#### search
Searches for skills by name or description within a directory. The search is case-insensitive.
```shell
./goskills-cli search ./testdata/skills "web app"
```

### 2. Skill Runner CLI (`goskills`)

Located in `cmd/goskills`, this tool simulates the Claude skill-use workflow by integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's models.

#### Building `goskills` runner

```shell
make runner
# or
go build -o goskills ./cmd/goskills
```

#### Available Commands

#### run
Processes a user request by first discovering available skills, then asking an LLM to select the most appropriate one, and finally executing the selected skill by feeding its content to the LLM as a system prompt.

**Requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.**

```shell
# Example with default OpenAI model (gpt-4o)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
./goskills run "create an algorithm that generates abstract art"

# Example with a custom OpenAI-compatible model and API base URL using environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2"
export OPENAI_MODEL="deepseek-v3"
./goskills run "create an algorithm that generates abstract art"

# Example with a custom OpenAI-compatible model and API base URL using command-line flags
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
./goskills run --model deepseek-v3 --api-base https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2 "create an algorithm that generates abstract art"

# Example with a custom OpenAI-compatible model and API base URL using command-line flags, auto-approve without human-in-the-loop
./goskills run --auto-approve --model deepseek-v3 --api-base https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2 "使用markitdown 工具解析网页 https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%94%E5%AD%90/1584"

# Example with a custom OpenAI-compatible model and API base URL using command-line flags, in a loop mode and not exit automatically
./goskills run --auto-approve --model deepseek-v3 --api-base https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2 --skills-dir=./testdata/skills "使用markitdown 工具解析网 页 https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AD%94%E5%AD%90/1584" -l
```
